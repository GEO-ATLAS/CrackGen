Deep learning shows great potential in crack recognition for civil infrastructure inspection, but its effectiveness is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data. The proposed CrackGen addresses this challenge by proposing a novel data generation framework that leverages fine-tuned Stable Diffusion models and ControlNet for controllable crack data synthesis. Through fine-tuning on small-size datasets, CrackGen develops the capability to generate diverse material textures and crack patterns while maintaining high fidelity to real-world characteristics. Unlike traditional data augmentation methods, CrackGen can generate both input images and their corresponding labels simultaneously, as the control conditions serve directly as ground truth labels. This unique approach enables generation of diverse crack patterns with controllable features, including customizable material textures, crack widths, and orientations. Comprehensive experiments analyze the impact of various generation parameters on the synthetic results. Multiple crack pattern generation strategies are introduced, including an innovative adaptation of the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm for generating fractal-like crack networks. Notably, models trained purely on CrackGen-generated datasets demonstrate robust performance when tested on real-world crack detection tasks, validating the high quality and practicality of the synthetic data. 

The complete codes will be open-sourced after our manuscript is accepted.
